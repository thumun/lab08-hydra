# Lab 08 - Creative Coding with Hydra
Let's explore creative coding and "live coding"! In this lab we'll be using [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), a tool for live coding interesting visuals. Hydra has a lot of support for new users, but it's best to learn by starting to play around. In addition to the [Hydra Documentation](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/), consider checking out these resources:

- What is modulation? https://hydra-book.glitch.me/#/modulation
- How to use textures? https://hydra-book.glitch.me/#/textures  
- A short starter walkthrough: https://www.clipsoundandmusic.uk/hydra-tutorial-a-beginners-guide-to-live-coding-visuals/
